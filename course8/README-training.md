Fantastic question!

In your example with:

> **"the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"**

Using something like:

```python
embedding_bag = nn.EmbeddingBag(num_embeddings=..., embedding_dim=..., mode='mean')
```

and processing the entire sentence as **one bag** (with `offsets = [0]`), here‚Äôs the key:

---

## üß† Does this encoding associate "quick" with "brown"?

### ‚ùå Not initially ‚Äî the embedding layer **doesn't inherently associate words with each other**.

### ‚úÖ Those associations are **learned during training**.

---

### üîç What's happening before training:

* Each word (like "quick", "brown", "fox", etc.) is mapped to a random vector from the embedding matrix.
* There's **no semantic relationship** yet ‚Äî "quick" and "brown" are just randomly located in space.

---

### ‚úÖ During Training:

If your model is being trained for a task (e.g., sentiment analysis, language modeling, classification), it will:

* Adjust the embeddings so that **words appearing in similar contexts** (like "quick" and "brown") get **similar vectors**.
* This is how the model begins to associate "quick" with "brown" (or with other adjectives, for example).

### üß† Example: Before vs After Training

| Word  | Before Training (Random Vectors) | After Training (Learned Associations) |
| ----- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| quick | \[0.32, -0.85, 0.01, ...]        | \[0.5, 0.3, 0.8, ...]                 |
| brown | \[-0.18, 0.75, 0.24, ...]        | \[0.51, 0.29, 0.81, ...]              |

After training, "quick" and "brown" might have **similar vectors**, because they tend to appear in similar **contexts**.

| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Is "quick" associated with "brown" up front? | ‚ùå No ‚Äî embeddings are random at first        |
| Are associations learned?                    | ‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî during training based on context     |
| What enables learning?                       | Backpropagation through the embedding matrix |

Let me know if you'd like to **visualize embedding similarity** between words before and after training!
