### üß† What Is an **N-gram** in Neural Networks (NNs)?

An **N-gram** is a **sequence of N consecutive items** (usually words or tokens) taken from a longer sequence. It‚Äôs a foundational concept in natural language processing (NLP), used for understanding and modeling **word context and order**.

### üìö Basic Examples

| N-gram Type   | Sentence       | Extracted N-grams                    |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Unigram (N=1) | "I like pizza" | `["I", "like", "pizza"]`             |
| Bigram (N=2)  | "I like pizza" | `[("I", "like"), ("like", "pizza")]` |
| Trigram (N=3) | "I like pizza" | `[("I", "like", "pizza")]`           |

## üîß In Neural Networks (esp. older NLP models):

* N-grams were used in **feature engineering** before deep learning took over
* Feed-forward neural networks often used **fixed-length N-gram inputs** to model local word context

### üß† How N-grams are used in NNs:

| Use Case                   | Purpose                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Language modeling**      | Predict the next word given the previous N‚Äì1 words                                                         |
| **Text classification**    | Capture short patterns (e.g., "not good")                                                                  |
| **Embedding models**       | Train word embeddings using N-gram contexts (e.g., Word2Vec, FastText)                                     |
| **Input to CNNs for text** | CNN kernels can simulate N-gram extraction over sequences                                                  |
| **Transformers**           | While not explicitly N-gram-based, attention mechanisms generalize N-gram modeling over long-range context |

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations of Traditional N-gram Models:

* **Data sparsity**: Rare N-grams are hard to learn from
* **Fixed context**: Can't capture long-range dependencies well
* **Explodes in size**: The number of N-grams grows quickly with vocabulary size and N

---

### ‚úÖ Modern Usage in Deep Learning:

While modern models like BERT and GPT **don‚Äôt explicitly use N-grams**, they:

* **Learn N-gram-like patterns** implicitly through attention
* Still benefit from N-gram-inspired features in preprocessing (e.g., subword tokenization)
