### 🔍 What is the **MMR Retrieval Algorithm** in Vector Stores (Neural Networks)?

**MMR** stands for **Maximal Marginal Relevance**, and it's a **retrieval algorithm** used in **vector databases** and **LLM pipelines** (like LangChain) to:

> **Balance relevance and diversity** when retrieving documents for a query.

## 🧠 Why Use MMR?

When retrieving top-k results from a vector store:

* Standard similarity search may return **highly similar** but **redundant** results.
* MMR tries to return **diverse and relevant** results to improve answer quality.

---

## ⚖️ MMR = Relevance + Diversity

MMR selects documents by:

* Maximizing **semantic similarity** to the query
* Minimizing **redundancy** among the selected documents

In other words:

```text
Score = λ * similarity_to_query - (1 - λ) * similarity_to_selected_docs
```

Where:

* **λ (lambda)** balances **relevance vs. diversity**
* Lower λ → more diversity
* Higher λ → more relevance

---

## 🧰 How It Works (Simplified Steps)

1. Embed the query into a vector.
2. Rank all documents by similarity to the query.
3. Iteratively select documents:

   * Prioritize relevance to query
   * Penalize overlap with already-selected docs
4. Stop after selecting `k` results.

## ✅ Example in LangChain

```python
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_type="mmr", lambda_mult=0.5, k=5)
docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents("Explain neural attention")
```

* `search_type="mmr"` activates MMR
* `lambda_mult=0.5` balances relevance and diversity
* `k=5` returns the top 5 diverse, relevant chunks

## ✅ Summary

| Feature      | Description                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔍 MMR       | Maximal Marginal Relevance                        |
| 📌 Goal      | Return **relevant and diverse** results           |
| ⚙️ Balances  | Query similarity and inter-document dissimilarity |
| 📈 Useful in | RAG, QA, semantic search, avoiding redundancy     |
