### 🧠 What Is **Text Splitting** in Neural Networks?

**Text splitting** is the process of breaking a large block of text into smaller, manageable **chunks** before feeding it into a neural network — especially **large language models (LLMs)** like GPT or BERT.

---

## 🔍 Why Is Text Splitting Used?

### 1. **Context Window Limits**

LLMs can only process a limited number of tokens at a time (e.g., GPT-4 typically supports 8k–32k tokens). If your document is longer:

* You **must split it**, or
* It gets **truncated**, and valuable content is lost

---

### 2. **Retrieval Efficiency**

In Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):

* You split documents into chunks
* Embed each chunk individually
* Retrieve only the relevant chunks based on a query

This improves **speed**, **relevance**, and **scalability**.

---

### 3. **Improved Comprehension**

Smaller chunks help the model:

* Stay focused
* Avoid irrelevant context
* Produce more **accurate**, **specific** answers

## ✅ Benefits of Text Splitting

| Benefit                         | Explanation                                             |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🚫 Prevents truncation          | Avoids hitting model input limits                       |
| 🔍 Improves retrieval accuracy  | Better matches query-relevant chunks                    |
| ⚙️ Enables scalable pipelines   | Works on large corpora one chunk at a time              |
| 🧠 Improves comprehension       | Less cognitive overload for the model per request       |
| 📈 Boosts performance in QA/RAG | Better quality of answers from context-specific prompts |

## 🧰 LangChain Text Splitting Tools

LangChain provides a powerful set of **text splitters**:

### 1. **`CharacterTextSplitter`**

* Splits text based on characters (e.g., paragraphs or line breaks)

```python
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
```

### 2. **`RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`** ✅ Most recommended

* Smartly splits at sentence/paragraph boundaries before falling back to characters

```python
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=50)
```

### 3. **`TokenTextSplitter`**

* Splits based on tokens (important when working with token limits)

```python
from langchain.text_splitter import TokenTextSplitter
```

### 4. **`MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter`**

* Splits by header levels in markdown docs (useful for structured content)

---

### 🔁 Example Use

```python
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain_core.documents import Document

text = "Very long document text here..."

splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=300, chunk_overlap=50)
docs = splitter.create_documents([text])
```

Each item in `docs` is a `Document` with `page_content` and optional `metadata`.
