### üîç What Is a **Retriever** in Neural Networks?

In the context of **neural networks**, especially **LLM-powered systems** like **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, a **retriever** is a component that:

> **Finds and returns the most relevant information** from a large knowledge base, given a user query ‚Äî usually based on **vector similarity** rather than keyword matching.

---

## üß† Why Do We Need Retrievers?

LLMs (like GPT) have a **limited context window** and don't know up-to-date facts or custom internal documents unless we:

1. **Store documents** as vector embeddings.
2. **Use a retriever** to find relevant chunks at query time.
3. **Inject those chunks** into the prompt for the LLM.

This setup makes it possible to **query long-term knowledge** without fine-tuning.

## üîó Where Retrievers Fit (RAG Pipeline)

```text
User Query
   ‚Üì
[Retriever] ‚Üê Embedding DB (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone)
   ‚Üì
Top-K Relevant Chunks (as LangChain Documents)
   ‚Üì
LLM (Generates the final response)
```

---

## üîß How Does a Retriever Work?

1. **Embeds** the user query into a vector.
2. **Searches** a vector store (using cosine similarity, etc.).
3. **Returns top-k results** that are semantically similar.

---

## ‚úÖ Example (LangChain)

```python
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_type="similarity", k=3)
docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents("What is quantum computing?")
```

* `vectorstore`: stores precomputed embeddings
* `retriever`: abstracts the retrieval logic
* `docs`: relevant text chunks returned as `Document` objects
