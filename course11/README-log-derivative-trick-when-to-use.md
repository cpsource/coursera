Fantastic question ‚Äî and the answer is:

> **Not quite.** The **log-derivative trick** is specifically for **sampling from a distribution**, not for handling non-differentiable **activation functions**.

## üß† When the Log-Derivative Trick Works

You use the **log-derivative trick** when you're trying to **compute gradients through random sampling** ‚Äî like:

* Sampling an action from a policy:
  $a \sim \pi_\theta(a|s)$
* Sampling a latent variable in a probabilistic model

That‚Äôs **not the same** as using a non-differentiable activation function.

## üö´ When It Does *Not* Apply

If you‚Äôre using an activation function like:

* `ReLU(x)`: OK ‚Äî it‚Äôs piecewise differentiable
* `sign(x)`: üö´ **not differentiable at 0**
* `step(x)` or `round(x)`: üö´ **not differentiable anywhere**

In those cases, **the log-derivative trick won‚Äôt help**, because:

* You‚Äôre not sampling from a distribution
* You‚Äôre just applying a deterministic, non-differentiable function

## ‚úÖ What to Use Instead for Non-Differentiable Activations

1. **Smooth approximations**:

   * Use `tanh(x)` instead of `sign(x)`
   * Use `sigmoid(x)` instead of `step(x)`
   * Use `softmax` instead of `argmax`

2. **Straight-through estimator (STE)** (used in quantized or binary networks):

   * Forward pass: use non-differentiable function (like `round`)
   * Backward pass: pretend it was identity

   ```python
   y = (x > 0).float()
   y.backward = lambda: 1  # simplified explanation of STE
   ```

3. **REINFORCE/log-derivative trick**:

   * Only when you **sample from a distribution**, like:

     ```python
     dist = Categorical(probs)
     action = dist.sample()
     ```

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Scenario                          | Use log-derivative trick? |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Sampling from a policy            | ‚úÖ Yes                     |
| Non-differentiable activation     | ‚ùå No                      |
| Sampling in VAEs or latent models | ‚úÖ Yes                     |
| Using `round`, `sign`, `step`     | ‚ùå Use STE or smoothing    |

Let me know what you're working with ‚Äî if you're hitting nondifferentiable activations or random choices, I can suggest a good workaround!
