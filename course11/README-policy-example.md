I'll walk you through this reinforcement learning code line by line. Think of this as training an AI agent to balance a pole on a cart - like balancing a broomstick on your finger, but the AI learns through trial and error.

## Imports and Setup
```python
import gymnasium as gym
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
import torch.optim as optim
```
These import the essential libraries: `gymnasium` for the game environment, and PyTorch components for building and training the neural network.

## Policy Network Definition
```python
class PolicyNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)
```
This creates the "brain" of our agent - a simple neural network with two layers. Think of it like a decision-making system that takes in observations about the world and outputs action preferences.

- `input_dim`: How many numbers describe the current state (like cart position, pole angle, etc.)
- `hidden_dim`: Size of the middle processing layer (128 neurons)  
- `output_dim`: Number of possible actions (move left or right)

```python
def forward(self, state):
    x = F.relu(self.fc1(state))
    x = self.fc2(x)
    return F.softmax(x, dim=-1)
```
This is how the network "thinks":
1. Take the current state through the first layer with ReLU activation (like a filter)
2. Pass through the second layer
3. Apply softmax to convert raw numbers into probabilities (like "60% chance move left, 40% chance move right")

## Environment Setup
```python
env = gym.make("CartPole-v1")
obs_dim = env.observation_space.shape[0]
n_actions = env.action_space.n
```
- Creates the CartPole game environment
- `obs_dim`: How many numbers describe the state (4 in CartPole: cart position, cart velocity, pole angle, pole angular velocity)
- `n_actions`: Number of possible actions (2: left or right)

## Initialize Training Components
```python
policy = PolicyNetwork(obs_dim, 128, n_actions)
optimizer = optim.Adam(policy.parameters(), lr=1e-2)
gamma = 0.99  # Discount factor
```
- Creates the policy network (4 inputs → 128 hidden → 2 outputs)
- Sets up the Adam optimizer to adjust network weights (learning rate = 0.01)
- `gamma`: How much we value future rewards vs immediate ones (0.99 means future rewards are worth 99% as much)

## Training Loop
```python
for episode in range(500):
    obs, _ = env.reset()
    log_probs = []
    rewards = []
    done = False
```
- Trains for 500 episodes (complete games)
- Resets environment to starting position
- Initializes lists to track what happened during this episode

## Collecting Experience
```python
while not done:
    obs_tensor = torch.tensor(obs, dtype=torch.float32)
    action_probs = policy(obs_tensor)
    dist = torch.distributions.Categorical(action_probs)
    action = dist.sample()
```
For each step in the episode:
- Convert observation to a PyTorch tensor
- Get action probabilities from the policy network
- Create a probability distribution (like a weighted coin flip)
- Sample an action based on those probabilities

```python
    log_probs.append(dist.log_prob(action))
    
    obs, reward, terminated, truncated, _ = env.step(action.item())
    rewards.append(reward)
    done = terminated or truncated
```
- Store the log probability of the chosen action (needed for learning)
- Execute the action in the environment
- Collect the reward and new observation
- Check if the episode ended (pole fell or time limit reached)

## Computing Discounted Rewards
```python
discounted_rewards = []
R = 0
for r in reversed(rewards):
    R = r + gamma * R
    discounted_rewards.insert(0, R)
```
This calculates how "good" each action was by looking at all future rewards. It's like giving credit to early good moves that led to later success. Working backwards through the episode, each reward gets added to a discounted sum of all future rewards.

## Reward Normalization
```python
discounted_rewards = torch.tensor(discounted_rewards)
discounted_rewards = (discounted_rewards - discounted_rewards.mean()) / (discounted_rewards.std() + 1e-8)
```
Normalizes the rewards to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1. This helps training stability - like grading on a curve so the network learns from relative performance rather than absolute reward values.

## Policy Update
```python
loss = -torch.sum(torch.stack(log_probs) * discounted_rewards)
optimizer.zero_grad()
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
```
This is where learning happens:
- Multiply log probabilities by discounted rewards (actions that led to good outcomes get reinforced)
- Negative sign because we want to maximize rewards, but optimizers minimize loss
- Standard PyTorch training step: zero gradients, compute gradients, update weights

## Progress Reporting
```python
if episode % 25 == 0:
    print(f"Episode {episode}, Total Reward: {sum(rewards):.1f}")
```
Every 25 episodes, prints the total reward to track learning progress.

**The Big Picture**: This implements REINFORCE, a policy gradient algorithm. The agent learns by trying actions, seeing what rewards it gets, and then adjusting its policy to make rewarding actions more likely in similar situations. It's like learning to ride a bike - you try different things, notice what keeps you balanced, and gradually get better at making the right moves.
