Absolutely â€” letâ€™s walk through the **entire `ppo_cartpole.py` script** line by line or in small logical blocks.

---

## ðŸ§  Overview

This script implements **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** on the **CartPole-v1** environment using `gymnasium` and `PyTorch`. PPO is a policy gradient algorithm that learns both a **policy** (what action to take) and a **value function** (how good a state is).

---

### âœ… DEVICE SETUP

```python
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
print(f"Using device: {device}")
```

* Automatically chooses GPU (`cuda`) if available; otherwise CPU.
* Everything later (tensors, models) will be moved to this device.

---

### âœ… NETWORK DEFINITION

```python
class ActorCritic(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, obs_dim, hidden_dim, n_actions):
        super().__init__()
        self.shared = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(obs_dim, hidden_dim),
            nn.ReLU()
        )
        self.actor = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, n_actions)
        self.critic = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, 1)
```

* Defines a **shared network** that feeds into:

  * An **actor head**: outputs logits for a **categorical action distribution**
  * A **critic head**: outputs a **single value estimate** $V(s)$

```python
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.shared(x)
        return self.actor(x), self.critic(x)
```

* On forward pass, returns:

  * **Logits** for action sampling
  * **Estimated value** of the state

---

### âœ… HYPERPARAMETERS

```python
hidden_size = 64
lr = 3e-4
gamma = 0.99
eps_clip = 0.2
K_epochs = 2
T_horizon = 50
```

* `hidden_size`: size of the shared layer
* `lr`: learning rate
* `gamma`: discount factor for future rewards
* `eps_clip`: PPO's clipping range
* `K_epochs`: how many PPO updates per batch
* `T_horizon`: how many environment steps to collect before each update

---

### âœ… ENVIRONMENT AND POLICY INITIALIZATION

```python
env = gym.make("CartPole-v1")
obs_dim = env.observation_space.shape[0]
n_actions = env.action_space.n
```

* Creates the environment and extracts:

  * Observation space size (CartPole has 4 features)
  * Number of possible actions (left or right â†’ 2)

```python
policy = ActorCritic(obs_dim, hidden_size, n_actions).to(device)
optimizer = optim.Adam(policy.parameters(), lr=lr)
```

* Instantiates the neural network and optimizer

---

### âœ… EXPERIENCE BUFFERS

```python
obs_buffer, action_buffer, logprob_buffer = [], [], []
reward_buffer, done_buffer, value_buffer = [], [], []
```

* Buffers to store experience from the environment during the rollout

---

### âœ… ROLLOUT PHASE (EXPERIENCE COLLECTION)

```python
obs, _ = env.reset()
total_reward = 0
```

* Resets environment and initializes total reward counter

```python
for _ in range(T_horizon):
    ...
```

* Loop through T\_horizon steps to collect experience

```python
    obs_tensor = torch.tensor(obs, dtype=torch.float32).to(device)
    logits, value = policy(obs_tensor)
    dist = Categorical(logits=logits)
    action = dist.sample()
```

* Converts observation to tensor and passes it through the network
* Samples an action from the **softmax distribution**

```python
    next_obs, reward, terminated, truncated, _ = env.step(action.item())
    done = terminated or truncated
```

* Executes action in the environment and collects feedback

```python
    # Save experience
    ...
    total_reward += reward
```

* Appends all relevant data to the buffers

```python
    obs = next_obs
    if done:
        obs, _ = env.reset()
```

* If episode ended, reset the environment

---

### âœ… COMPUTE RETURNS AND ADVANTAGES

```python
returns = []
G = 0
for r, d in zip(reversed(reward_buffer), reversed(done_buffer)):
    G = r + gamma * G * (1 - d)
    returns.insert(0, G)
```

* Computes the **discounted return** $G_t$ for each time step
* `1 - d` ensures return is reset after episode ends

```python
returns = torch.tensor(returns, dtype=torch.float32).to(device)
value_tensor = torch.stack(value_buffer).squeeze()
advantages = (returns - value_tensor.detach()).detach()
```

* Computes **advantage**: how much better the action did than expected
* `.detach()` is crucial to avoid backprop errors across multiple epochs

---

### âœ… PPO POLICY UPDATE

```python
obs_tensor = torch.stack(obs_buffer).to(device)
action_tensor = torch.stack(action_buffer).to(device)
logprob_tensor = torch.stack(logprob_buffer).detach().to(device)
```

* Packs and moves buffers to tensors for batch training

```python
for _ in range(K_epochs):
    logits, values = policy(obs_tensor)
    dist = Categorical(logits=logits)
    new_logprobs = dist.log_prob(action_tensor)
    ratio = (new_logprobs - logprob_tensor).exp()
```

* Recomputes log probabilities and importance ratios

```python
    surr1 = ratio * advantages
    surr2 = torch.clamp(ratio, 1 - eps_clip, 1 + eps_clip) * advantages
    actor_loss = -torch.min(surr1, surr2).mean()
    critic_loss = (returns - values.squeeze()).pow(2).mean()
    loss = actor_loss + 0.5 * critic_loss
```

* **PPO clipped objective**: restricts how far policy is allowed to move
* Critic is updated via mean squared error between predicted and actual return

```python
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```

* Standard PyTorch backpropagation

---

### âœ… FINAL OUTPUT

```python
print(f"\nâœ… PPO training complete. Total reward during rollout: {total_reward:.2f}")
```

* Displays total accumulated reward for the rollout episode
