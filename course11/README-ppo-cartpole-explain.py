Exactly! Let’s break down **what PPO is really doing** at its core — and answer your question:

> “The essence is to run 50 trials, collect that data, then massage that data, then somehow use it to train **what**?”

## 🔁 What’s being trained?

You are training a **neural network** that does **two things at once**:

1. **Policy**: A function that maps a state → probabilities over actions

   $$
   \pi_\theta(a|s)
   $$

2. **Value function**: A function that estimates how good a state is

   $$
   V_\phi(s)
   $$

These are often combined in one shared network — hence the name **Actor-Critic**:

* **Actor** chooses what to do.
* **Critic** evaluates how good that state or action was.

## 🧠 So what happens during those 50 steps?

Let’s break it into a 4-phase loop:

---

### ✅ 1. **Run policy for 50 steps (rollout)**

* Use the current policy to **act** in the environment.
* Collect:

  * State
  * Action taken
  * Log probability of that action
  * Reward received
  * Whether episode ended
  * Estimated value of the state

---

### ✅ 2. **“Massage” the data**

This means:

* **Compute discounted returns** $G_t = r_t + \gamma r_{t+1} + \dots$
* **Estimate advantage**: how much better an action was than expected:

  $$
  A_t = G_t - V(s_t)
  $$

This gives a better learning signal than just reward.

---

### ✅ 3. **Train the policy (Actor)**

You use **policy gradient methods** to:

* Adjust the policy parameters $\theta$
* Make actions that led to higher advantages **more probable**
* Make bad actions **less probable**

PPO’s trick is: **don’t let the policy change too much in one step** (clipped update).

---

### ✅ 4. **Train the critic (Value function)**

Use regression:

$$
\text{Loss} = \left(V(s_t) - G_t\right)^2
$$

So that the critic learns to better predict returns.

---

## 🔁 Loop it over and over

Each cycle makes the policy better at:

* Choosing good actions
* Understanding long-term value

Over time, your agent learns **how to balance the pole better and better**.

---

## 🧠 Final Answer

> You're training a **neural network** to:
>
> * **Predict good actions** given a state (policy)
> * **Estimate how good a state is** (value)

Using:

* Collected data from interaction with the environment
* Computed advantage estimates
* PPO loss to control stability of learning

Let me know if you want this extended to full episode training or visualized!
