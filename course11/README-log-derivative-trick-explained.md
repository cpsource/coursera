Absolutely â€” letâ€™s walk through a **working PyTorch example** of the **log-derivative trick** (REINFORCE style), and clarify **what you can't take the derivative of**, and **why this trick is needed**.

---

## ðŸ§  What Canâ€™t You Take the Derivative Of?

You **can't take the derivative through a discrete sampling operation** â€” like this:

```python
action = torch.multinomial(action_probs, num_samples=1)
```

* This sampling step is **non-differentiable** â€” gradients donâ€™t flow through random selection.
* The action taken (e.g., 0 or 1) is not a function with a defined gradient.

So you canâ€™t just do:

```python
loss = reward  # and call loss.backward()
```

because reward doesnâ€™t depend on parameters in a differentiable way.

## âœ… The Log-Derivative Trick to the Rescue

Instead, we use:

$$
\text{gradient} = \text{reward} \times \nabla \log \pi(a)
$$

This **log probability** is differentiable with respect to the model's parameters, even if the sampled action is not.

## âœ… Working Example: REINFORCE with Log-Derivative Trick

Weâ€™ll create a neural network that learns to favor action 0 or 1 depending on a simple rule:

* If the input is positive â†’ action 1 should be rewarded
* If the input is negative â†’ action 0 should be rewarded

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.distributions import Categorical

# A simple policy network: maps 1D input â†’ logits for 2 actions
class PolicyNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(1, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

# Initialize
policy = PolicyNet()
optimizer = optim.Adam(policy.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training loop
for episode in range(200):
    x = torch.tensor([[1.0]]) if torch.rand(1).item() > 0.5 else torch.tensor([[-1.0]])

    # Forward pass
    logits = policy(x)
    dist = Categorical(logits=logits)
    action = dist.sample()
    log_prob = dist.log_prob(action)

    # Simulated reward
    # If x > 0 â†’ reward 1 for action 1
    # If x < 0 â†’ reward 1 for action 0
    correct = int((x.item() > 0 and action.item() == 1) or (x.item() < 0 and action.item() == 0))
    reward = torch.tensor(float(correct))

    # Log-derivative trick:
    loss = -log_prob * reward

    # Update
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    if episode % 20 == 0:
        print(f"Episode {episode}, x={x.item():.1f}, action={action.item()}, reward={reward.item()}, loss={loss.item():.4f}")
```

### ðŸ§  Whatâ€™s Happening:

* `log_prob = dist.log_prob(action)` is differentiable
* `reward` is **not** a function of the model (it comes from the world), so we **treat it as a constant**
* We multiply `log_prob` by `reward` â†’ this gives us a valid gradient **even though action is sampled**

---

### ðŸ”¬ What It Learns:

Over time, the model will learn:

* For inputs > 0 â†’ favor action 1
* For inputs < 0 â†’ favor action 0

Because those actions yield rewards, and the **log-derivative trick** adjusts parameters to increase the log-probability of those actions.

## âœ… Summary

\| You can't differentiate through | Discrete `sample()` from a categorical distribution |
\| You *can* differentiate | `log_prob(action)` w\.r.t. the model |
\| The trick | Use `-log_prob(action) * reward` as a differentiable surrogate loss |
\| Key use case | Policy gradient methods (REINFORCE, PPO), stochastic nodes in variational inference |
