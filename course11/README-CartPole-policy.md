Sure! Here's a **line-by-line explanation** of your code, which creates a reinforcement learning policy using a neural network and simulates a single decision ("rollout step") in the `CartPole-v1` environment:

---

### üî¢ Code Walkthrough

```python
import gym
```

‚û°Ô∏è **Imports the Gym library**, which provides simulation environments like `CartPole-v1` for reinforcement learning.

---

```python
# Create environment and policy
env = gym.make("CartPole-v1")
```

‚û°Ô∏è **Creates the CartPole environment**, where the goal is to balance a pole on a moving cart by choosing discrete left/right actions.

---

```python
obs_dim = env.observation_space.shape[0]   # e.g., 4
```

‚û°Ô∏è Retrieves the **dimension of the observation space**.
For CartPole, the state is a vector of 4 floats:

* Cart position
* Cart velocity
* Pole angle
* Pole angular velocity

---

```python
n_actions = env.action_space.n             # e.g., 2
```

‚û°Ô∏è Retrieves the number of **discrete actions** (possible outputs).
For CartPole: `0` = push left, `1` = push right

---

```python
policy = PolicyNetwork(obs_dim, 128, n_actions)
```

‚û°Ô∏è Initializes your **policy network** (a neural network) with:

* `obs_dim` input neurons
* `128` hidden neurons
* `n_actions` output neurons

This network will take a state and produce a probability distribution over actions.

---

```python
# Simulate a rollout
obs, _ = env.reset()
```

‚û°Ô∏è **Resets the environment** and gets the initial observation (`obs`).
Using the **new Gym API**, `env.reset()` returns a tuple: `(obs, info)` ‚Äî we discard `info`.

---

```python
obs_tensor = torch.tensor(obs, dtype=torch.float32)
```

‚û°Ô∏è Converts the observation (a NumPy array) to a **PyTorch tensor** so it can be passed to the neural network.

---

```python
# Get action probabilities from the policy
action_probs = policy(obs_tensor)
```

‚û°Ô∏è Feeds the observation into the **policy network**, which returns a **probability distribution** over actions using softmax.

---

```python
action = torch.multinomial(action_probs, num_samples=1).item()  # sample an action
```

‚û°Ô∏è **Samples one action** based on the probabilities.

* `multinomial` treats `action_probs` as a categorical distribution.
* `.item()` converts the result from a tensor to a plain integer.

---

```python
print("Action probabilities:", action_probs.detach().numpy())
```

‚û°Ô∏è Prints the probability of each action.

* `.detach()` removes the tensor from the computation graph (no gradients needed).
* `.numpy()` converts it to a NumPy array for easy printing.

---

```python
print("Chosen action:", action)
```

‚û°Ô∏è Displays which action was actually sampled ‚Äî either `0` (left) or `1` (right).

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

This code:

1. Creates a CartPole environment.
2. Defines a neural network as a policy.
3. Observes the initial state.
4. Uses the policy to get action probabilities.
5. Samples and prints the selected action.

Let me know if you'd like to continue the rollout for multiple steps, calculate rewards, or train the policy!
