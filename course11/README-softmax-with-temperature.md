Great question! This implementation of `softmax_with_temperature` is designed with **numerical stability and temperature scaling** in mind. Let‚Äôs break it down step by step:

---

### üîç The Function:

```python
def softmax_with_temperature(logits, T):
    z = logits / T
    e_z = np.exp(z - np.max(z))  # numerical stability
    return e_z / e_z.sum()
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Explanation:

#### **1. `z = logits / T` ‚Äî Apply temperature**

* Temperature scaling modifies the **"sharpness"** of the softmax distribution:

  * **T < 1** ‚Üí sharper distribution (more confident)
  * **T > 1** ‚Üí flatter distribution (more exploratory)
* Dividing logits by `T` applies this control **before softmax**.
* This is standard in generation tasks to control randomness.

---

#### **2. `np.exp(z - np.max(z))` ‚Äî Numerical Stability**

* Softmax involves exponentials, and large numbers (e.g., `exp(1000)`) can cause **overflow errors**.
* So we **subtract the maximum value** in `z` from every element:

  ```python
  z' = z - max(z)
  ```

  This:

  * Doesn‚Äôt change the result (because softmax is **invariant to constant shifts**),
  * But **prevents the exponentials from blowing up**.

**Why it works:**

$$
\frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_j e^{z_j}} = \frac{e^{z_i - c}}{\sum_j e^{z_j - c}}
$$

for any constant $c$, typically $\max(z)$.

---

#### **3. `e_z / e_z.sum()` ‚Äî Standard softmax**

* Finally, you divide each exponentiated element by the sum of all exponentials:

  $$
  P_i = \frac{e^{z_i / T}}{\sum_j e^{z_j / T}}
  $$
* This converts the values into a **probability distribution** that sums to 1.

### üß† Summary:

| Line                    | Purpose                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `z = logits / T`        | Controls sharpness via temperature   |
| `np.exp(z - np.max(z))` | Prevents overflow (numerical safety) |
| `e_z / e_z.sum()`       | Computes normalized probabilities    |

Let me know if you want to see a version without the stability fix and compare how it fails for large logits.
