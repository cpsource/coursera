The '''dog''' ('''''Canis familiaris''''' or '''''Canis lupus familiaris''''') is a [[Domestication of vertebrates|domesticated]] descendant of the [[gray wolf]]. Also called the '''domestic dog''', it was [[Selective breeding|selectively bred]] from an [[extinct]] population of wolves during the [[Late Pleistocene]] by [[hunter-gatherer]]s. The dog was the first [[species]] to be domesticated by [[human]]s, over 14,000 years ago and before the [[History of agriculture|development of agriculture]]. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a [[starch]]-rich diet that would be inadequate for other [[Canidae|canid]]s.

Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. [[Dog breed]]s vary widely in shape, size, and color. They have the same number of bones (with the exception of the tail), powerful jaws that house around 42 teeth, and well-developed [[Dog sense of smell|senses of smell]], hearing, and sight. Compared to humans, dogs possess a superior sense of smell and hearing, but inferior [[visual acuity]]. Dogs perform many roles for humans, such as [[Hunting dog|hunting]], [[Herding dog|herding]], [[Sled dog|pulling loads]], [[Guard dog|protection]], [[Pet|companionship]], [[Therapy dog|therapy]], [[Service dog|aiding disabled people]], and [[Police dog|assisting police]] and the [[Dogs in warfare|military]].

[[Dog communication|Communication in dogs]] includes eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements of bodies and limbs), and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones, and taste). They mark their territories by urinating on them, which is more likely when entering a new environment. Over the millennia, dogs have uniquely adapted to human behavior; this adaptation includes being able to understand and communicate with humans. As such, the [[human–canine bond]] has been a topic of frequent study, and dogs' influence on human society has given them the [[sobriquet]] of "[[man's best friend]]".

The global dog population is estimated at 700&nbsp;million to 1&nbsp;billion, [[Cosmopolitan distribution|distributed around the world]]. The dog is the most popular pet in the United States, present in 34–40% of households. Developed countries make up approximately 20% of the global dog population, while around 75% of dogs are estimated to be from developing countries, mainly in the form of feral and community dogs.

Dogs, wolves, and [[dingo]]es have sometimes been classified as separate species.<ref name="Thiele-2019" /> In 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist [[Carl Linnaeus]] assigned the [[genus]] name ''[[Canis]]'' (which is the [[Latin]] word for "dog"){{sfn|Wang|Tedford|2008|p=58}} to the domestic dog, the [[wolf]], and the [[golden jackal]] in his book, ''[[10th edition of Systema Naturae|Systema Naturae]]''. He classified the domestic dog as ''Canis familiaris'' and, on the next page, classified the grey wolf as ''Canis lupus''.<ref name=linnaeus1758 /> Linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its upturning tail (''cauda recurvata'' in [[Latin]] term), which is not found in any other [[canid]].<ref name=Clutton-Brock1995 /> In the 2005 edition of ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'', [[mammalogist]] [[W. Christopher Wozencraft]] listed the wolf as a wild subspecies of ''Canis lupus'' and proposed two additional subspecies: ''familiaris'', as named by Linnaeus in 1758, and ''dingo'', named by Meyer in 1793. Wozencraft included ''hallstromi'' (the New Guinea singing dog) as another name ([[junior synonym]]) for the dingo. This classification was informed by a 1999 [[mitochondrial DNA]] study.<ref name=wozencraft2005 />

The classification of dingoes is disputed and a political issue in Australia. Classifying dingoes as wild dogs simplifies reducing or controlling dingo populations that threaten livestock. Treating dingoes as a separate species allows conservation programs to protect the dingo population.<ref>{{cite journal |display-authors=4 |last1=Donfrancesco |first1=Valerio |last2=Allen |first2=Benjamin L. |last3=Appleby |first3=Rob |last4=Behrendorff |first4=Linda |last5=Conroy |first5=Gabriel |last6=Crowther |first6=Mathew S. |last7=Dickman |first7=Christopher R. |last8=Doherty |first8=Tim |last9=Fancourt |first9=Bronwyn A. |last10=Gordon |first10=Christopher E. |last11=Jackson |first11=Stephen M. |last12=Johnson |first12=Chris N. |last13=Kennedy |first13=Malcolm S. |last14=Koungoulos |first14=Loukas |last15=Letnic |first15=Mike |last16=Leung |first16=Luke K.-P. |last17=Mitchell |first17=Kieren J. |last18=Nesbitt |first18=Bradley |last19=Newsome |first19=Thomas |last20=Pacioni |first20=Carlo |last21=Phillip |first21=Justine |last22=Purcell |first22=Brad V. |last23=Ritchie |first23=Euan G. |last24=Smith |first24=Bradley P. |last25=Stephens |first25=Danielle |last26=Tatler |first26=Jack |last27=van Eeden |first27=Lily M. |last28=Cairns |first28=Kylie M. |title=Understanding conflict among experts working on controversial species: A case study on the Australian dingo |journal=Conservation Science and Practice |date=March 2023 |volume=5 |issue=3 |doi=10.1111/csp2.12900 |bibcode=2023ConSP...5E2900D |url=https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/csp2.12900 |language=en |issn=2578-4854|hdl=2440/137822 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> Dingo classification affects wildlife management policies, legislation, and societal attitudes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boronyak |first1=Louise |last2=Jacobs |first2=Brent |last3=Smith |first3=Bradley |title=Unlocking Lethal Dingo Management in Australia |journal=Diversity |date=May 2023 |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=642 |doi=10.3390/d15050642 |doi-access=free |bibcode=2023Diver..15..642B }}</ref> In 2019, a workshop hosted by the [[IUCN]]/Species Survival Commission's Canid Specialist Group considered the dingo and the New Guinea singing dog to be [[feral dog|feral]] ''Canis familiaris''.

=== Domestication ===
{{Main|Domestication of the dog}}
[[File:Comparison of a wolf and a pug.png|thumb|Wolves (left) were domesticated by humans into dogs (right)]]
The earliest remains generally accepted to be those of a domesticated dog were discovered in [[Oberkassel, Bonn|Bonn-Oberkassel]], Germany. [[Contextualism|Contextual]], [[Isotope analysis|isotopic]], [[Genetics|genetic]], and [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] evidence shows that this dog was not a local wolf.<ref name=Perri2021 /> The dog was dated to 14,223 years ago and was found buried along with a man and a woman, all three having been sprayed with red [[hematite]] powder and buried under large, thick basalt blocks. The dog had died of [[canine distemper]].<ref name=janssens2018 /> This timing indicates that the dog was the [[Domestication of vertebrates|first species to be domesticated]]<ref name=larson2014 /><ref name=freedman2017 /> in the time of [[hunter-gatherer]]s,<ref name=Frantz2020 /> which predates agriculture.<ref name=Thalmann2018 /> Earlier remains dating back to 30,000 years ago have been described as [[Paleolithic dog]]s, but their status as dogs or wolves remains debated<ref name=Irving-Pease2018 /> because considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves during the [[Late Pleistocene]].<ref name=Thalmann2018 />

[[DNA sequences]] show that all ancient and modern dogs share a common ancestry and descended from an ancient, extinct wolf population that was distinct from any [[Wolf|modern wolf]] lineage. Some studies have posited that all living wolves are more closely related to each other than to dogs,<ref name="Bergström2020" /><ref name=Frantz2020 /> while others have suggested that dogs are more closely related to modern Eurasian wolves than to American wolves.<ref name=":43">{{Cite journal |last1=Gojobori |first1=Jun |last2=Arakawa |first2=Nami |last3=Xiaokaiti |first3=Xiayire |last4=Matsumoto |first4=Yuki |last5=Matsumura |first5=Shuichi |last6=Hongo |first6=Hitomi |last7=Ishiguro |first7=Naotaka |last8=Terai |first8=Yohey |date=23 February 2024 |title=Japanese wolves are most closely related to dogs and share DNA with East Eurasian dogs |journal=Nature Communications |volume=15 |issue=1 |page=1680 |doi=10.1038/s41467-024-46124-y |pmid=38396028 |pmc=10891106 |bibcode=2024NatCo..15.1680G }}</ref>

The dog is a domestic animal that likely travelled a [[Commensalism|commensal]] pathway into domestication (i.e. humans initially neither benefitted nor were harmed by wild dogs eating refuse from their camps).<ref name=Irving-Pease2018 /><ref name=larson2012 /> The questions of when and where dogs were first domesticated remains uncertain.<ref name=larson2014 /> Genetic studies suggest a domestication process commencing over 25,000 years ago, in one or several wolf populations in either Europe, the high Arctic, or eastern Asia.<ref name=Ostrander2019 /> In 2021, a [[literature review]] of the current evidence [[Inference|infers]] that the dog was domesticated in [[Siberia]] 23,000 years ago by [[ancient North Siberians]], then later dispersed eastward into the Americas and westward across Eurasia,<ref name=Perri2021 /> with dogs likely accompanying the first humans to inhabit the Americas.<ref name=Perri2021/> Some studies have suggested that the extinct [[Japanese wolf]] is closely related to the ancestor of domestic dogs.<ref name=":43"/>

In 2018, a study identified 429 genes that differed between modern dogs and modern wolves. As the differences in these genes could also be found in ancient dog fossils, these were regarded as being the result of the initial domestication and not from recent breed formation. These genes are linked to [[neural crest]] and [[central nervous system]] development. These genes affect [[embryogenesis]] and can confer tameness, smaller jaws, floppy ears, and diminished craniofacial development, which distinguish domesticated dogs from wolves and are considered to reflect domestication syndrome. The study concluded that during early dog domestication, the initial selection was for behavior. This trait is influenced by those genes which act in the neural crest, which led to the phenotypes observed in modern dogs.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Pendleton |first1=Amanda L. |last2=Shen |first2=Feichen |last3=Taravella |first3=Angela M. |last4=Emery |first4=Sarah |last5=Veeramah |first5=Krishna R. |last6=Boyko |first6=Adam R. |last7=Kidd |first7=Jeffrey M. |date=December 2018 |title=Comparison of village dog and wolf genomes highlights the role of the neural crest in dog domestication |journal=BMC Biology |language=en |volume=16 |issue=1 |page=64 |doi=10.1186/s12915-018-0535-2 |issn=1741-7007 |pmc=6022502 |pmid=29950181 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

Compared to the dog's wolf-like ancestors, selective breeding since domestication has seen the dog's skeleton increase in size for larger types such as [[mastiff]]s and miniaturised for smaller types such as [[terrier]]s; [[dwarfism]] has been selectively bred for some types where short legs are preferred, such as [[dachshund]]s and [[corgi]]s.{{sfnp|Fogle|2009|pp=38-39}} Most dogs naturally have 26 vertebrae in their tails, but some with [[Natural bobtail|naturally short tails]] have as few as three.{{sfnp|Cunliffe|2004|p=12}}

Dogs have stiff, deeply embedded hairs known as [[whisker]]s that sense atmospheric changes, vibrations, and objects not visible in low light conditions. The lower most part of whiskers hold more receptor cells than other hair types, which help in alerting dogs of objects that could collide with the nose, ears, and jaw. Whiskers likely also facilitate the movement of food towards the mouth.<ref>{{Cite news |date=24 June 2015 |title=Dog Senses - A Dog's Sense of Touch Compared to Humans {{!}} Puppy And Dog Care |work=Puppy And Dog Care |url=http://blog.puppyanddogcare.com/dog-senses-touch/ |access-date=18 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624013803/http://blog.puppyanddogcare.com/dog-senses-touch/ |archive-date=24 June 2015 | vauthors = Care PA }}</ref>

=== Coat ===
{{Main|Dog coat}}The [[Pelage|coats]] of domestic dogs are of two varieties: "double" being common in dogs (as well as wolves) originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse [[guard hair]] and a soft [[down hair]], or "single", with the topcoat only. Breeds may have an occasional "blaze", stripe, or "star" of white fur on their chest or underside.{{sfnp|Cunliffe|2004|pp=22–23}} Premature graying can occur in dogs as early as one year of age; this is associated with [[Impulsivity|impulsive behaviors]], [[anxiety]] behaviors, and fear of unfamiliar noise, people, or animals.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2016.09.013|title=Anxiety and impulsivity: Factors associated with premature graying in young dogs|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=185|pages=78–85|year=2016|last1=King|first1=Camille|last2=Smith|first2=Thomas J.|last3=Grandin|first3=Temple|last4=Borchelt|first4=Peter|doi-access=free}}</ref> Some dog breeds are hairless, while others have a very thick corded coat. The coats of certain breeds are often groomed to a characteristic style, for example, the [[Yorkshire Terrier]]'s "show cut".<ref name=":3" />

=== Dewclaw ===
A dog's [[dewclaw]] is the fifth [[Digit (anatomy)|digit]] in its forelimb and hind legs. Dewclaws on the forelimbs are attached by bone and ligament, while the dewclaws on the hind legs are attached only by skin. Most dogs are not born with dewclaws in their hind legs, and some are without them in their forelimbs. Dogs' dewclaws consist of the [[Phalanx bone|proximal phalanges and distal phalanges]]. Some publications theorize that dewclaws in wolves, who usually do not have dewclaws, were a sign of hybridization with dogs.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ciucci |first1=Paolo |last2=Lucchini |first2=Vittorio |last3=Boitani |first3=Luigi |last4=Randi |first4=Ettore |title=Dewclaws in wolves as evidence of admixed ancestry with dogs |journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology |date=December 2003 |volume=81 |issue=12 |pages=2077–2081 |doi=10.1139/z03-183 |bibcode=2003CaJZ...81.2077C }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Amici |first1=Federica |last2=Meacci |first2=Simone |last3=Caray |first3=Emmeline |last4=Oña |first4=Linda |last5=Liebal |first5=Katja |last6=Ciucci |first6=Paolo |year=2024 |title=A first exploratory comparison of the behaviour of wolves (Canis lupus) and wolf-dog hybrids in captivity |journal=Animal Cognition |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=9 |doi=10.1007/s10071-024-01849-7 |pmid=38429445 |pmc=10907477 }}</ref>

=== Tail ===
A dog's tail is the terminal appendage of the [[vertebral column]], which is made up of a string of 5 to 23 [[vertebra]]e enclosed in muscles and skin that support the dog's back extensor muscles.

Neutering is less common in most European countries, especially in [[Nordic countries]]—except for the UK, where it is common. In Norway, neutering is illegal unless for the benefit of the animal's health (e.g., ovariohysterectomy in case of ovarian or uterine neoplasia). Some European countries have similar laws to Norway, but their wording either explicitly allows for neutering for controlling reproduction or it is allowed in practice or by contradiction through other laws. Italy and Portugal have passed recent laws that promote it. Germany forbids early age neutering, but neutering is still allowed at the usual age. In Romania, neutering is mandatory except for when a pedigree to select breeds can be shown.<ref name="neuter" /><ref>{{cite journal | last=Fossati | first=Paola | title=Spay/neuter laws as a debated approach to stabilizing the populations of dogs and cats: An overview of the European legal framework and remarks | journal=Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science | publisher=Informa UK Limited | volume=27 | issue=2 | date=31 May 2022 | issn=1088-8705 | doi=10.1080/10888705.2022.2081807 | pages=281–293| pmid=35642302 }}</ref>

Researchers have tested dogs' ability to perceive information, retain it as knowledge, and apply it to solve problems. Studies of two dogs suggest that dogs can learn by [[inference]]. A study with [[Rico (Border Collie)|Rico]], a [[Border Collie]], showed that he knew the labels of over 200 different items. He inferred the names of novel things by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those new items after four weeks of the initial exposure. A study of another Border Collie, Chaser, documented that he had learned the names and could associate them by verbal command with over 1,000 words.<ref>{{cite book|author=Pilley, John |year=2013|title=Chaser: Unlocking the genius of the dog who knows a thousand words|publisher = [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|isbn=978-0-544-10257-6}}</ref>

Humans communicate with dogs by using vocalization, hand signals, and body posture. With their acute sense of hearing, dogs rely on the auditory aspect of communication for understanding and responding to various cues, including the distinctive [[bark (sound)|barking]] patterns that convey different messages. A study using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) has shown that dogs respond to both vocal and nonvocal voices using the brain's region towards the [[Cerebral hemisphere|temporal pole]], similar to that of humans' brains.

Research has, however, pointed to significantly less [[absenteeism]] from school through sickness among children who live with pets.</blockquote> Health benefits of dogs can result from contact with dogs in general, not solely from having dogs as pets.
