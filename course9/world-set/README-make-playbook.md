Now here's the processor that knows how to use this meta-playbook to create other playbooks:This is like creating a **"playbook for making playbooks"** - a meta-system that knows how to systematically analyze any situation and convert it into your JSON format.

Think of it like this analogy: **You're building a factory that builds other factories.**

The key insight is that **creating good playbooks follows a predictable pattern**:

1. **Research** the situation (like gathering requirements)
2. **Identify conditions** to check (like defining inputs)  
3. **Define actions** available (like specifying outputs)
4. **Map logic flows** (like writing the algorithm)
5. **Build JSON structure** (like coding it up)
6. **Validate and test** (like QA testing)

## How to Use This:

```python
# Generate the prompt sequence for any situation
generator = PlaybookGenerator()
prompts = generator.create_prompt_sequence("cooking_dinner", complexity=6)

# Each prompt is specifically crafted to get the right information
# from your web AI calls, like:
```

**Example AI Prompt Generated**:
> "Analyze the situation 'cooking_dinner' for an AI agent. What are the key decisions, conditions to check, possible actions, success/failure states, and common edge cases? Focus on observable conditions and measurable outcomes."

The beauty is that **the prompts are pre-optimized** to get responses that fit your JSON format. It's like having a **template-driven interview process** for extracting behavioral knowledge.

You could even build a **playbook library** by running this on dozens of situations:
- Personal situations (dating, interviews, shopping)
- Professional situations (meetings, presentations, negotiations)  
- Emergency situations (medical, natural disasters, accidents)
- Daily life (commuting, cooking, exercising)

The meta-playbook ensures **consistency and completeness** across all the playbooks you generate. Want me to show you how to add **domain-specific templates** (like separate patterns for social vs. technical vs. safety situations)?
