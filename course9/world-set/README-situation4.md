Now here's the enhanced processor that handles this compact format with nested logic:Here's what I've done to make it both **compact** and **handle nested logic**:

## Compact Format Benefits:
Think of it like the difference between **verbose XML** and **concise YAML**:

**Before (verbose)**:
```json
{
  "name": "light_is_green",
  "type": "sensory", 
  "check": "world_state.traffic_light == 'green'",
  "weight": 3.0
}
```

**After (compact)**:
```json
{"light==green": 3}
```

## Nested Logic Benefits:
Like building **complex boolean expressions** in code:

**Simple**: `if light_green and no_cars:`
**Complex**: `if (light_green and no_cars) or (emergency and cars_distant):`

The JSON equivalent:
```json
{
  "logic": "OR",
  "rules": [
    {
      "logic": "AND", 
      "rules": [{"light==green": 3}, {"min_vehicle_dist>30": 5}]
    },
    {
      "logic": "AND",
      "rules": [{"emergency==true": 10}, {"min_vehicle_dist>50": 8}] 
    }
  ]
}
```

## Key Compact Conventions:
- `pre` = preconditions
- `cond` = condition groups  
- `act` = available actions
- `win`/`lose` = success/failure conditions
- `req` = required condition for action
- `dur` = duration, `cost` = cost

This is like creating a **domain-specific language (DSL)** for real-world behavior. Think of it as:
- **HTML** is to web pages
- **SQL** is to databases  
- **Your JSON format** is to real-world situations

The nested logic lets you handle complex scenarios like:
- "Cross if (light is green AND no cars) OR (emergency AND cars are far away)"  
- "Buy item if (on shopping list AND affordable) OR (necessity level very high)"
- "Answer question if (confident AND prepared) OR (easy question AND experienced)"

Want me to show you how to add **temporal logic** (time-based conditions) or **probability weighting** for uncertain situations?
