### 🧠 What is $d_k$ in Attention?

In the attention formula:

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

* $Q$ = Query matrix
* $K$ = Key matrix
* $V$ = Value matrix
* $d_k$ = **dimensionality of the key vectors**

---

### ✅ Why divide by $\sqrt{d_k}$?

* Without it, the **dot product of Q and K** could produce large values when $d_k$ is large.
* Applying softmax to large values can lead to **very small gradients**, making training unstable.
* Dividing by $\sqrt{d_k}$ helps to **normalize** the values before softmax, ensuring **stable gradients**.

> Think of it as a **scaling factor** to keep the attention scores well-behaved.

### 📐 Typical Dimensions

In practice:

* $Q, K, V \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_k}$
* If you're using **multi-head attention**:

  * Each head gets its own smaller $d_k$, often $d_k = d_{\text{model}} / \text{num_heads}$
