In a **Transformer neural network**, the **feed-forward layer** plays a critical role in transforming token representations **independently at each position** after self-attention has been applied.

### 🧠 What It Does

The **feed-forward layer** is a **position-wise** operation that applies the same two-layer neural network to each token embedding (vector) in the sequence.

It helps the model:

* Learn **nonlinear combinations** of features.
* Introduce **depth** and **expressiveness** beyond attention.

### 🧱 Architecture of a Feed-Forward Layer

For each token vector $x$, the feed-forward network applies:

$$
\text{FFN}(x) = \text{ReLU}(xW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2
$$

Where:

* $W_1$ and $W_2$ are learned weight matrices.
* $b_1$ and $b_2$ are biases.
* `ReLU` is a non-linear activation function.

📌 Sometimes GELU is used instead of ReLU in models like BERT.

### 🔁 Applied **Independently at Each Token Position**

Unlike self-attention (which mixes information across positions), the feed-forward layer processes **each position separately**. This adds expressive power without mixing positions.

---

### 🔄 Full Transformer Block

A typical transformer block looks like:

1. **Self-attention layer**
2. **Add & Norm**
3. **Feed-forward layer**
4. **Add & Norm**

Each step is critical to learning rich contextual representations.
