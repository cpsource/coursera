Great question — that line is **crucial** in the self-attention mechanism. Let's break it down clearly:

### 🔁 Step 2: Why Create Linear Projections for Q, K, V?

```python
W_q = torch.nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim)
W_k = torch.nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim)
W_v = torch.nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim)
```

These lines define **learnable projection layers** for generating:

* **Q (query)**
* **K (key)**
* **V (value)**

---

### 🧠 Why do we need these?

> Because we want the model to **learn what to attend to** — and each projection helps shape that.

---

### 📘 Context

Your input `x` is of shape:

```python
(batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim)
```

That’s just a sequence of embeddings.

But in attention, you compute:

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right) V
$$

So you need:

* `Q = W_q(x)`
* `K = W_k(x)`
* `V = W_v(x)`

These projections allow the model to **reinterpret the same embedding** into:

* A **query vector**: "what am I looking for?"
* A **key vector**: "what do I offer?"
* A **value vector**: "what information can I provide?"

---

### 🧱 Without These Projections:

* All tokens would attend using the **same raw embeddings** — no learnable customization.
* You'd get **poor or no learning**, and attention would be fixed or meaningless.

### ✅ Summary

| Component | Meaning                                      |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `W_q`     | Learns how to turn input into "queries"      |
| `W_k`     | Learns how to turn input into "keys"         |
| `W_v`     | Learns how to turn input into "values"       |
| Output    | Customized Q, K, V for each token, each head |

Would you like me to show how these matrices look and differ when trained?
