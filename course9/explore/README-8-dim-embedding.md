Great question!

### 🔍 What Are 8-Dimensional Embeddings?

When we say a sentence has 4 tokens with **8-dimensional embeddings**, it means:

> Each word (token) is represented by an **8-element vector** — not just a single number.

---

### 🧠 Why Do We Use Vectors Instead of Scalars?

Words have rich meanings that can't be captured by one number.

So:

* We represent each token using an **embedding vector**.
* This vector captures various semantic and syntactic features.

Think of each dimension as encoding one aspect:

| Dimension | Might Capture  |
| --------- | -------------- |
| 1         | Formality      |
| 2         | Tense          |
| 3         | Subjectivity   |
| …         | …              |
| 8         | Word frequency |

These dimensions are **learned** during training.

### 📘 Example:

Say the sentence is:

> “I love deep learning”

After tokenization and embedding, the input becomes a tensor of shape:

```
(batch_size=1, seq_len=4, embed_dim=8)
```

One possible token vector (for “love”) might look like:

```python
[ 0.12, -0.45, 0.88, 0.01, -0.34, 0.76, 0.03, -0.10 ]
```

### 🔁 Summary

| Term          | Meaning                                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Token**     | A word or subword (like "love", "ing")         |
| **Embedding** | A vector representation of a token             |
| **8-dim**     | Each token is represented by 8 values          |
| **Shape**     | For 4 tokens, the embedding tensor is `(4, 8)` |

Would you like a visualization showing how these vectors are packed into a sequence tensor?
