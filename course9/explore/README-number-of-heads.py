Great question! You're working with multi-head attention — let's zoom in on:

---

### 🧠 **What is `num_heads` used for in Multi-Head Attention?**

In a transformer, **multi-head attention** means:

> Instead of computing a single attention output, the model computes **multiple independent attention heads** in parallel — then combines them.

---

### ✅ Why Multiple Heads?

Each head learns to focus on **different aspects of the input**:

* One head might focus on **syntax**
* Another might learn **coreference resolution**
* Another might detect **long-range dependencies**

This improves the **representational power** of the attention mechanism.

---

### 📘 In Your Code:

```python
embed_dim = 8
num_heads = 2
head_dim = embed_dim // num_heads  # => 4
```

This means:

* Each attention head works in a **4D subspace** (head\_dim = 4)
* There are 2 independent attention paths
* Each path uses its own projections and computes its own attention scores

---

### 🔁 What Happens Next?

Later (which you may not have pasted yet), you’ll do:

```python
# Reshape Q, K, V for multi-head: (batch, heads, seq, head_dim)
Q = Q.view(batch_size, seq_len, num_heads, head_dim).transpose(1, 2)
```

This splits the 8-dim space into **two 4-dim heads**, like:

```
Head 1 → [0:4]
Head 2 → [4:8]
```

Then:

* Each head computes attention separately
* Their outputs are concatenated and passed through another linear layer

### ✅ Summary

| Concept        | Meaning                                                               |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `num_heads`    | Number of parallel attention mechanisms                               |
| `head_dim`     | Dimensionality of each head’s subspace                                |
| Why use heads? | Learn multiple types of dependencies across token positions           |
| Output         | All heads' results are concatenated: shape = (batch, seq, embed\_dim) |

Would you like a visual or simulation showing how two heads might focus on different parts of a sentence?
