### 🧠 What Is an **Attention Mechanism** in Neural Networks?

An **attention mechanism** is a technique that allows a neural network to **focus on the most relevant parts of the input** when producing an output — especially useful in tasks involving **sequences**, like:

* Machine translation
* Text summarization
* Question answering
* Image captioning

## ✅ Why It Was Introduced

Traditional sequence models like RNNs or LSTMs **compress the entire input sequence into a single fixed-length vector**, which becomes a **bottleneck** for long inputs.

**Attention solves this** by letting the model:

> "Look back" at **all input tokens** and decide **how much each one matters** for generating the current output token.

## 🏗️ How Attention Works (Simplified)

For each output token being generated:

1. Compute a **score** for how much each input token should be attended to.
2. Convert scores into **weights** using softmax (so they sum to 1).
3. Compute a **weighted sum of the input vectors** → this becomes the context vector.
4. Use this context to generate the output.

### 🧪 Example: English to French

For translating "I love you" → "Je t’aime"

When generating "t’aime", the model might **attend most** to "love", less to "I" or "you".

## 🧠 In Transformers

In **Transformers** (e.g., BERT, GPT):

* Attention is the **core building block**.
* Every token can attend to **every other token** in a sentence.
* It’s called **"self-attention"** when tokens attend to one another within the same sequence.

## 🧾 Mathematical Summary

Given query $Q$, key $K$, and value $V$:

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

* $Q$: what we're trying to match (query)
* $K$: what we compare against (keys)
* $V$: what we actually retrieve (values)
