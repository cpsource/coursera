Great question! Let's break down the **significance of each hyperparameter** in the context of your positional encoding and transformer-related model setup:

---

## âœ… Hyperparameter Breakdown

### ðŸ”¹ 1. `embedding_dim = 4`

This defines the **dimensionality of the embedding vector** for each token (word or subword).

| Why it matters   | Explanation                                                                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Feature richness | Each word is represented as a 4D vector â€” more dimensions = more expressive power. |
| Size trade-off   | Small = fast & low memory, Large = better representation but heavier to train.     |
| Typical values   | 4 is **tiny** (used for demos); in real models, itâ€™s often **100â€“1024+**           |

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. `seq_len = 3`

This defines the **number of tokens in a single input sequence** (sentence length).

| Why it matters      | Explanation                                                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Controls time steps | In transformers/RNNs, each token is a step in the sequence. |
| Memory footprint    | Longer sequences = more computation.                        |
| Positional encoding | Applied across `seq_len` tokens.                            |

> In your example: a 3-token input sentence will get 3 positional encodings added to its embeddings.

### ðŸ”¹ 3. `batch_size = 1`

This defines how many sequences (examples) you process **in parallel** during a forward pass.

| Why it matters      | Explanation                                        |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Training efficiency | Larger batches = better GPU usage.                 |
| Variability         | Smaller batches = noisier gradients (if training). |
| Demo simplicity     | `1` is great for step-by-step illustration.        |

> In your example: You're feeding **one sentence** of **3 words**, where each word is a 4-dimensional vector.

## ðŸ§ª Resulting Tensor Shapes

With:

```python
embedding_dim = 4
seq_len = 3
batch_size = 1
```

Your simulated input `x` will have shape:

```
(batch_size, seq_len, embedding_dim) = (1, 3, 4)
```

This means:

* 1 sequence
* 3 tokens
* Each token = 4D vector

## âœ… Summary Table

| Hyperparameter  | Role                           | Typical Range              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| `embedding_dim` | Dimensionality of word vectors | 50â€“1024+                   |
| `seq_len`       | Number of tokens per input     | 1â€“512+                     |
| `batch_size`    | Number of sequences per batch  | 1â€“64+ (training), 1 (demo) |
