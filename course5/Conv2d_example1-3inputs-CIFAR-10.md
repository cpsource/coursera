Absolutely! There are several excellent color datasets we can use. Let me show you some popular options and convert the code to use a real color dataset.Perfect! There are several excellent color datasets available. Let me convert the code to use **CIFAR-10**, which is the most popular choice for demonstrating 3-channel CNNs:Perfect! I've converted the code to use **CIFAR-10**, which is the most popular color dataset for learning CNNs. Here are the excellent color datasets available:

## **Popular Color Datasets:**

1. **CIFAR-10** (What we're using):
   - 60,000 32×32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class
   - Classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck
   - Perfect for learning 3-channel CNNs

2. **CIFAR-100**:
   - 60,000 32×32 color images in 100 classes, with 600 images per class grouped into 20 superclasses
   - More challenging than CIFAR-10

3. **SVHN (Street View House Numbers)**:
   - Real-world color images of house numbers
   - Similar to MNIST but with color and more realistic backgrounds

## **Key Changes Made:**

1. **Architecture Improvements**:
   - **3 convolutional layers** instead of 2 (better for complex color images)
   - **Batch normalization** added for stable training
   - **More filters**: 32→64→128 (color images need more feature detectors)

2. **CIFAR-10 Specific**:
   - **Proper normalization**: Uses CIFAR-10 statistics instead of MNIST
   - **Data augmentation**: Random flips and rotations for better generalization
   - **Learning rate scheduler**: Adapts learning rate during training

3. **Enhanced Visualization**:
   - **RGB filter display**: Shows how filters respond to color channels
   - **Per-class accuracy**: See which objects are easier/harder to classify
   - **Sample predictions**: Visual feedback on model performance

## **Why CIFAR-10 is Perfect for Learning:**

- **Real RGB data**: Unlike our artificial 3-channel MNIST conversion
- **Manageable size**: 32×32 images train reasonably fast
- **Diverse objects**: Animals, vehicles, various shapes and textures
- **Established benchmark**: Easy to compare your results with literature

## **Expected Results:**
- **Good performance**: 70-85% accuracy (much harder than MNIST's ~99%)
- **Filter evolution**: First layer learns color edges, deeper layers learn textures and shapes
- **Real-world applicability**: Skills transfer to larger color datasets

The code demonstrates all the key concepts of working with color datasets and shows how the network learns to use RGB information effectively. Try running it and see how the filters learn to detect different color patterns and textures!
