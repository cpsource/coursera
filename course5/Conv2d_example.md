I'll create a comprehensive CNN example using PyTorch with MNIST. This will be like building a pattern recognition system where each convolutional filter learns to detect specific features (edges, shapes, textures) - similar to how your eye might first notice edges, then combine them to recognize letters.This CNN example is like building a visual recognition system that mimics how your brain processes images - starting with simple edge detectors and building up to complex pattern recognizers.

Here's what each part does:

**The Architecture (like a pipeline):**
- **Conv1**: 16 filters that act like different "edge detectors" - some might detect vertical lines, others horizontal or diagonal
- **Conv2**: 32 filters that combine the edge information to detect more complex shapes like curves or corners
- **Pooling**: Reduces image size while keeping important features (like thumbnailing but smarter)
- **Fully Connected**: Makes the final decision about which digit it sees

**Key Learning Points:**

1. **Filter Visualization**: The code shows you exactly what patterns each filter learned to detect. First layer filters often look like edge detectors, while second layer filters detect more complex combinations.

2. **Progressive Feature Learning**: Like reading - you first recognize individual strokes, then combine them into letters. The network learns this hierarchy automatically.

3. **Hyperparameter Organization**: Everything configurable is at the top, making it easy to experiment (try changing `CONV1_CHANNELS` to 32 or `LEARNING_RATE` to 0.01).

The print statements will show you:
- Training progress with loss and accuracy
- Filter statistics (what ranges of values they learned)
- Sample predictions with confidence scores
- Detailed breakdown of what each filter detected

Think of each convolutional filter as a specialized "detector" - after training, you'll see some became horizontal line detectors, others became corner detectors, etc. The beauty is that the network figured out these useful features automatically from the data!
