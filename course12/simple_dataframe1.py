# ============ WHAT MAKES THIS AN AGENT ============
# An agent has 3 key components:
# 1. BRAIN (LLM) - Decides what to do
# 2. TOOLS - Actions it can take  
# 3. EXECUTOR - Runs the decision-making loop

# Load environment variables

# This way you can run the example without needing an external file

# The pandas agent automatically gets these tools:
# - python_repl_ast: Execute Python code
# - dataframe_info: Get info about the DataFrame
# - dataframe_head: Show first few rows
# - dataframe_describe: Get statistical summary
