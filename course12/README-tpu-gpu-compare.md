TPU speeds can be **dramatically faster** than GPUs for many ML workloads, but it depends heavily on the specific task. Here's the breakdown:

## Speed Comparison Overview

**TPUs Excel At (5-50x faster):**
- **Large matrix multiplications** (the core of neural networks)
- **Transformer models** (BERT, GPT, T5)
- **Computer vision models** (ResNet, Vision Transformers)
- **Training large models** with high batch sizes
- **Mixed precision training** (bfloat16)

**GPUs Still Better For:**
- **Small batch sizes** or irregular workloads
- **Custom operations** not optimized for TPU
- **Debugging** (more flexible)
- **General-purpose computing**

## Real-World Benchmarks

```python
# Let's test your TPU v6 lite vs typical GPU performance
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import time

def benchmark_operations():
    print("=" * 50)
    print("TPU PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS")
    print("=" * 50)
    
    # Matrix multiplication (TPU's strength)
    sizes = [(1000, 1000), (2000, 2000), (4000, 4000)]
    
    for size in sizes:
        @jax.jit
        def matmul_test():
            a = jnp.ones(size)
            b = jnp.ones(size)
            return jnp.dot(a, b)
        
        # Warm up
        _ = matmul_test()
        
        # Benchmark
        start = time.time()
        for _ in range(10):
            result = matmul_test()
        end = time.time()
        
        avg_time = (end - start) / 10
        operations = 2 * size[0] * size[1] * size[0]  # FLOPS
        tflops = operations / avg_time / 1e12
        
        print(f"Matrix {size[0]}x{size[1]}:")
        print(f"  Time: {avg_time:.4f}s")
        print(f"  Performance: {tflops:.2f} TFLOPS")
        print()

```

## Typical Performance Numbers

### **High-End GPU (A100)**
- **Matrix ops**: ~300 TFLOPS (mixed precision)
- **Memory**: 40-80 GB HBM
- **Memory bandwidth**: ~2 TB/s
- **Power**: ~400W

### **TPU v4 (comparable generation)**
- **Matrix ops**: ~275 TFLOPS (bfloat16)
- **Memory**: 32 GB HBM
- **Memory bandwidth**: ~1.2 TB/s
- **Power**: ~200W

### **Your TPU v6 lite**
- **Much newer architecture** (likely 2-3x more efficient than v4)
- **Single core** vs multi-core setups
- **Optimized for efficiency** rather than raw throughput

## Model Training Comparisons

```python
# Example: Training speed comparisons for common models

"""
BERT-Large Training (typical batch sizes):
- GPU (V100): ~1.2 samples/sec
- TPU v3: ~3.5 samples/sec  (3x faster)
- TPU v4: ~5.8 samples/sec  (5x faster)

GPT-3 Style Models:
- GPU clusters: Baseline
- TPU pods: 3-5x faster due to better interconnect

ResNet-50 Training:
- GPU (V100): ~400 images/sec
- TPU v3: ~1000 images/sec (2.5x faster)
"""
```

## Why TPUs Can Be Much Faster

**1. Architecture Optimized for ML:**
```python
# TPUs are designed specifically for this pattern:
@jax.jit
def typical_ml_operation(x):
    # Large matrix multiply (TPU's specialty)
    y = jnp.dot(x, weights)
    # Element-wise operations (very efficient on TPU)
    y = jnp.relu(y)
    return y
```

**2. Better Memory Design:**
- **High bandwidth memory** directly connected to compute
- **No cache misses** for predictable ML workloads
- **Systolic arrays** for efficient matrix operations

**3. Software Stack:**
- **XLA compiler** optimizes entire computation graphs
- **Automatic mixed precision** (bfloat16)
- **Better parallelization** across cores

## Real Example: Test on Your TPU

```python
# Compare with typical GPU performance
def ml_workflow_benchmark():
    # Simulate a typical ML forward pass
    batch_size = 64
    seq_length = 512
    hidden_size = 768
    
    @jax.jit
    def transformer_like_computation():
        # Input embeddings
        x = jnp.ones((batch_size, seq_length, hidden_size))
        
        # Attention-like operations (matrix multiplies)
        q = jnp.dot(x, jnp.ones((hidden_size, hidden_size)))
        k = jnp.dot(x, jnp.ones((hidden_size, hidden_size)))
        v = jnp.dot(x, jnp.ones((hidden_size, hidden_size)))
        
        # Attention computation
        attention = jnp.dot(q, k.transpose()) / jnp.sqrt(hidden_size)
        attention = jax.nn.softmax(attention)
        output = jnp.dot(attention, v)
        
        # Feed forward
        ff = jnp.dot(output, jnp.ones((hidden_size, hidden_size * 4)))
        ff = jax.nn.relu(ff)
        ff = jnp.dot(ff, jnp.ones((hidden_size * 4, hidden_size)))
        
        return jnp.sum(ff)
    
    # Warm up
    _ = transformer_like_computation()
    
    # Benchmark
    start = time.time()
    for _ in range(100):
        result = transformer_like_computation()
    end = time.time()
    
    avg_time = (end - start) / 100
    print(f"Transformer-like computation: {avg_time:.4f}s per iteration")
    print(f"Throughput: {1/avg_time:.1f} iterations/second")
    
    # This would typically be 3-10x slower on equivalent GPU
    return avg_time

ml_workflow_benchmark()
```

## Bottom Line

For **your use case** with TPU v6 lite:
- **Training neural networks**: Likely 3-10x faster than comparable GPU
- **Large matrix operations**: Significantly faster
- **Small models or debugging**: GPU might be more convenient
- **Cost efficiency**: TPUs often provide better performance/dollar for ML

Your TPU v6 lite is actually quite powerful - it's using the latest TPU architecture which is much more efficient than older generations!
